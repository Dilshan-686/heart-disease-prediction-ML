# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses **supervised machine learning algorithms** to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient health data from the **UCI Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset**.

---

## 📊 Problem Statement

Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction of heart disease can significantly improve outcomes by enabling timely intervention. This project explores the use of machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease using features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and more.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)
- **File used**: `processed.cleveland.data`
- **Total samples**: 297
- **Target**: Binary classification (0 = No heart disease, 1 = Presence of heart disease)

---

## ⚙️ Algorithms Implemented

This project applies and compares the performance of:

- ✅ **Logistic Regression**
- ✅ **Random Forest**

Both models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

---

## 📈 Results

- **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** both achieved an accuracy of approximately **88%**.
- Metrics were well-balanced between classes.
- Confusion matrices showed consistent performance, with only a few misclassifications.

---

## 🔍 Key Learnings

- Logistic Regression, though simple, was very effective.
- Random Forest added robustness but didn’t significantly outperform the linear model.
- Simpler models can perform surprisingly well when the data is clean and informative.

---

## 🧠 Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`
- Try ensemble methods like XGBoost
- Add cross-validation
- Explore feature engineering for better model interpretability
